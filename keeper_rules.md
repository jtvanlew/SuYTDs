Notes:
1. When trading any draft pick for a player, must also receive a draft in order to balance the number of drafts in the next year. i.e. i trade a 1st round draft pick to get cooper kupp, the other manager gives cooper kupp + 16th round pick

2. If a player is ever drafted, they keep that "value" until the next time they are drafted. i.e. a 4th round draft pick is dropped halfway through the season with injury and then picked up at the very end of season - they still count as a 4th round draft pick
